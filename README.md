### An prototype for the Uber Experiences Hackathon.

The idea was to create something that correlates your current company's motive
with the uber experience api. I ended up creating a spinning wheel that will run
only when you finish a kilometer in Uber. If the spin wheeel hits flash sale,
you get to buy things at a very discounted price for the next 1 minute.

This is just the frontend part, you can play around inside the `app` folder.
